# Shakshuka

Shakshouka (Arabic: شكشوكة‎, also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka) is a Maghrebi dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion and garlic, and commonly spiced with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. 

# Why Shakshuka

Imagine, it's 2005 and I'm merely 69 years old.
The marriage hasn't been going too well with both of us in retirement, every day we'd just sit around in the house and get on each others nerves. Then my wifes birthday came around and our wonderful kids gifted us a trip to Tel Aviv. Little did we know that it would be the greatest trip we've ever taken (and not just for the memories ;)).

Let me tell you: Tel Aviv is beautiful!!1! It's hip, vibrant and simply stunning. There are all kinds of restaurants out there, but I digress.
We arrived in Tel Aviv and the smell alone got you hungry, the first night we were eating in the hotel which was okay, but that's our own fault I guess.
We decided to go hiking through the Hayarkon Park and around Tel Aviv to get a feel for the spiritual energy surrounding us. On arriving we noticed how good it felt and how it immediately improved our feelings towards each other.
Then, after a long day of hiking we got back into the City to get a bite to eat, geniuses we were we actually learnt from our mistake and only went back to the hotel to get a change of clothes (the heat, dear god.. there was so much sweat).

After a bit of.. laying around (^^) and showering we got back out into the vibrant streets again. We heard a lot about the "touristy" restaurants where you basically get the tourist-friendly food (i.e. Burgers with fries...) which we definitely didn't want. So we muddled our way through the other tourists and got into the back alleys of the town. There were a lot of different tiny ambient shops to choose from, in the end we settled in a restaurant which was rather empty.

We didn't speak the language and neither did they speak english, but oh well, you kinda get away with using your hands and feet.
They then got us some random foods and, you might've guessed it, it was Shakshuka.

**And it was amazing, especially if you use the recipe from below ;)**
Is anyone actually reading all of this? I kinda promised 1000+ words, anyway here are the wonderwall lyrics:

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)

\*spiel den selben song nochmal*
Alles klar den selben Song und los

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you but I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)

I hope you've been actually sining this wonderful song and not just skipping over it. Thanks to all the people who inspired me to be this creative. It's truly an honor to work with myself, it's been going great so far if I do say so myself. 1000 words here we are.
